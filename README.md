# Vehicle Management System

## Introduction
The Vehicle Management System is a comprehensive application designed to streamline the management of vehicle catalogs. It provides users with the ability to perform various actions such as adding, removing, and searching for vehicles based on different criteria like speed and price. This repository contains the source code and documentation for the Vehicle Management System.

## Features
- Add new vehicles to the catalog
- Remove vehicles from the catalog
- Search for vehicles based on speed and price
- User authentication and registration
- Efficient and modular system architecture


## Usage
1. Upon running the application, you will be prompted to authenticate or register as a new user.

2. Once authenticated, you can access the main menu to perform various actions such as adding, removing, or searching for vehicles.

3. Follow the on-screen instructions to navigate through the application and utilize its features.

## System Architecture
The Vehicle Management System is built upon a modular architecture consisting of several interconnected components:
- **Catalog Subsystem:** Manages vehicle information and operations.
- **Authentication Subsystem:** Handles user authentication and registration.

## Technical Details
- **Design Patterns:** Utilizes Singleton, Proxy, and Decorator patterns to enhance code structure and extensibility.
- **Software Engineering Principles:** Adheres to SOLID principles, promoting modularity and maintainability.
- **Challenges:** Overcame technical challenges related to environment setup, user authentication, and functionality expansion.
